#Export Detailed Bank Transaction Data From Zoho Books

I was inspired by this project: https://github.com/jgrossiord/zoho-invoice-get-receipt/blob/master/importInvoices.rb

Basically... It's a pain to export all of your bank transactions to bring them into another system (like one that supports shoeboxed...)
This will grab all types of transactions, pull in basic customer info, and descriptions so you can shoehorn them into another application.

It's pretty clunky, but it worked for me.
